## Development build

This is a python package, and built using the [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) build tool.

To install locally, create a virtual environment for python 3.9+, 
install poetry, and then install or build the package with `poetry install` or `poetry build`, respectively.

To run tests, navigate to the root directory and run `pytest -s`. The test suite contains tests that
take a longer time to run (relating to the storage of large files) - to execute all tests, run
`pytest --run-slow`. To see detailed
